# ICProject: Machine Learning Based Regression Analysis and Classification of Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) Designs

Welcome to the repository for my ICProject! This project leverages machine learning to analyze and classify Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) based on their design specifications and performance metrics. Below, you'll find an overview of the project, key objectives, instructions for replicating results, and references.

üîç Project Purpose
The objective of this project is to employ machine learning models for:

Clustering and Classification of UGV Designs

Utilize unsupervised clustering algorithms (K-Means) to group UGVs based on their performance metrics.
Use these clusters to train supervised classifiers to categorize UGVs into predefined performance classes:
Low
Moderate
Standard
Advanced

Regression Analysis for Operational Range Prediction

Build regression models to predict the operational range of UGVs based on other performance metrics.
